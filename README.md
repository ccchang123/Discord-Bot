## Setup
### Client Setup
Setting up the Discord Bot is relatively painless:

First, put discordbot.exe, config.json and lang folder in same folder

and use the file editor to set the [config.json](https://github.com/ccchang123/Discord-Bot/wiki/config) file.

After that, configure the bot to ensure its connection to Discord.
